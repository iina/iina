# Build

**Use pre-compiled dylibs**

1. Please make sure CocoaPods is installed.

  **gem**
  ```
  sudo gem install cocoapods
  ```
  **homebrew**
  ```
  brew install cocoapods
  ```

2. Run pod install in project root directory.
  ```
  pod install
  ```
  
3. Open `.xcworkspace` file.

Theoretically no extra work is needed. _If you are unwilling to use the provided dylibs, follow the instructions below._

**Build with the lastest mpv**

* Install mpv

  ```
  brew install mpv --with-uchardet
  ```
  
  Feel free to include any other libraries if you like.
  
* Copy latest [header files](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/tree/master/libmpv) into `libmpv/include/mpv/`

* other/parse_doc.rb

  This script will fetch the *lastest* mpv documentation and generate `MPVOption.swift`, `MPVCommand.swift` and `MPVProperty.swift`. This is only needed when updating libmpv. Note that if the API changes, the player source code may also need to be changed.

* other/change_lib_dependencies.rb

  This script will deploy the depended libraries into `libmpv/libs`.
  Make sure you have a phase copying of all these dylibs in Xcode's build settings.
