## Building

IINA ships with pre-compiled dynamic libraries for convenience reasons. If you aren't planning on modifying these libraries, you can follow the instructions below to build IINA; otherwise, skip down to [Building mpv manually](#building-mpv-manually) and then run the steps here:

### Using the pre-compiled libraries

1. IINA uses [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) for managing the installation of third-party libraries. If you don't already have it installed, here's how you can do so:

#### Using RubyGems
```console
$ sudo gem install cocoapods
```

#### Using Homebrew
```console
$ brew install cocoapods
```

2. Run `pod install` in project's root directory.

3. Open iina.xcworkspace in the [latest public version of Xcode](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835). *IINA may not build if you use any other version.*

### Building mpv manually

1. Install mpv:

```console
$ brew install mpv --with-uchardet
```
Feel free to include your own copies of the other libraries if you'd like.

2. Copy latest [header files](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/tree/master/libmpv) into `libmpv/include/mpv/`.

3. Run `other/parse_doc.rb`. This script will fetch the latest mpv documentation and generate `MPVOption.swift`, `MPVCommand.swift` and `MPVProperty.swift`. This is only needed when updating libmpv. Note that if the API changes, the player source code may also need to be changed.

4. Run `other/change_lib_dependencies.rb`. This script will deploy the depended libraries into `libmpv/libs`.
  Make sure you have a phase copying of all these dylibs in Xcode's build settings.

## Contributing

IINA is always looking for contributions, whether it's through bug reports, code, or new translations.

* If you find a bug in IINA, or would like to suggest a new feature or enhancement, it'd be nice if you could [search your problem first](https://github.com/iina/iina/issues); while we don't mind duplicates, keeping issues unique helps us save time and considates effort. If you can't find your issue, feel free to [file a new one](https://github.com/iina/iina/issues/new).

* If you're looking to contribute code, please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)–it has information on IINA's process for handling contributions, and tips on how the code is structured to make your work easier.
* If you'd like to translate IINA to your language, please check the [Translation Status](https://github.com/iina/iina/wiki/Translation-Status) page first: if a language is labeled as "Need help", then feel free to [update the translation](https://github.com/iina/iina/wiki/Translation#update-translations). If it doesn't contain your language at all, you can [submit a new translation](https://github.com/iina/iina/wiki/Translation). If you need help working on a translation, you can contact [@lhc70000](https://github.com/lhc70000) or file an issue and one of the maintainers will try to help you out.
