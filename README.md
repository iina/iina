# Build

Please make sure cocoapods is installed.

```
sudo gem install cocoapods
```

Run pod install in project root directory.

```
pod install
```

Theoretically no extra work is needed. _If you are unwilling to use the provided dylibs, follow the instructions below._

**Install mpv**

```
brew install mpv --with-uchardet
```
Currently `ytdl` is not included when building, but will be considered in later versions.

**other/parse_doc.rb**

This script will fetch the *lastest* mpv documentation and generate `MPVOption.swift`, `MPVCommand.swift` and `MPVProperty.swift`. Only needed when updating libmpv. Note that once API changed, player source code may also need to be changed.

**other/change_lib_dependencies.rb**

This script will resolve library dependencies and copy all required dylibs into `libmpv/libs`.

Before running this script, you should first copy libmpv into `libmpv/libs`, like:

```
cp path/to/libmpv ./libmpv/libs
sudo install_name_tool -id @executable_path/../Frameworks/libmpv.1.23.0.dylib ./libmpv/lib/libmpv.1.23.0.dylib
```

Where `path/to/libmpv` should be in your homebrew install path.

Make sure in Xcode build settings, you have a phase copying all these dylibs.
