/**
 * Mechanisms provided by this API
 * -------------------------------
 *
 * This API provides general control over mpv playback. It does not give you
 * direct access to individual components of the player, only the whole thing.
 * It's somewhat equivalent to MPlayer's slave mode. You can send commands,
 * retrieve or set playback status or settings with properties, and receive
 * events.
 *
 * The API can be used in two ways:
 * 1) Internally in mpv, to provide additional features to the command line
 *    player. Lua scripting uses this. (Currently there is no plugin API to
 *    get a client API handle in external user code. It has to be a fixed
 *    part of the player at compilation time.)
 * 2) Using mpv as a library with mpv_create(). This basically allows embedding
 *    mpv in other applications.
 *
 * Documentation
 * -------------
 *
 * The libmpv C API is documented directly in this header. Note that most
 * actual interaction with this player is done through
 * options/commands/properties, which can be accessed through this API.
 * Essentially everything is done with them, including loading a file,
 * retrieving playback progress, and so on.
 *
 * These are documented elsewhere:
 *      * http://mpv.io/manual/master/#options
 *      * http://mpv.io/manual/master/#list-of-input-commands
 *      * http://mpv.io/manual/master/#properties
 *
 * You can also look at the examples here:
 *      * https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv-examples/tree/master/libmpv
 *
 * Event loop
 * ----------
 *
 * In general, the API user should run an event loop in order to receive events.
 * This event loop should call mpv_wait_event(), which will return once a new
 * mpv client API is available. It is also possible to integrate client API
 * usage in other event loops (e.g. GUI toolkits) with the
 * mpv_set_wakeup_callback() function, and then polling for events by calling
 * mpv_wait_event() with a 0 timeout.
 *
 * Note that the event loop is detached from the actual player. Not calling
 * mpv_wait_event() will not stop playback. It will eventually congest the
 * event queue of your API handle, though.
 *
 * Synchronous vs. asynchronous calls
 * ----------------------------------
 *
 * The API allows both synchronous and asynchronous calls. Synchronous calls
 * have to wait until the playback core is ready, which currently can take
 * an unbounded time (e.g. if network is slow or unresponsive). Asynchronous
 * calls just queue operations as requests, and return the result of the
 * operation as events.
 *
 * Asynchronous calls
 * ------------------
 *
 * The client API includes asynchronous functions. These allow you to send
 * requests instantly, and get replies as events at a later point. The
 * requests are made with functions carrying the _async suffix, and replies
 * are returned by mpv_wait_event() (interleaved with the normal event stream).
 *
 * A 64 bit userdata value is used to allow the user to associate requests
 * with replies. The value is passed as reply_userdata parameter to the request
 * function. The reply to the request will have the reply
 * mpv_event->reply_userdata field set to the same value as the
 * reply_userdata parameter of the corresponding request.
 *
 * This userdata value is arbitrary and is never interpreted by the API. Note
 * that the userdata value 0 is also allowed, but then the client must be
 * careful not accidentally interpret the mpv_event->reply_userdata if an
 * event is not a reply. (For non-replies, this field is set to 0.)
 *
 * Asynchronous calls may be reordered in arbitrarily with other synchronous
 * and asynchronous calls. If you want a guaranteed order, you need to wait
 * until asynchronous calls report completion before doing the next call.
 *
 * See also the section "Asynchronous command details" in the manpage.
 *
 * Multithreading
 * --------------
 *
 * The client API is generally fully thread-safe, unless otherwise noted.
 * Currently, there is no real advantage in using more than 1 thread to access
 * the client API, since everything is serialized through a single lock in the
 * playback core.
 *
 * Basic environment requirements
 * ------------------------------
 *
 * This documents basic requirements on the C environment. This is especially
 * important if mpv is used as library with mpv_create().
 *
 * - The LC_NUMERIC locale category must be set to "C". If your program calls
 *   setlocale(), be sure not to use LC_ALL, or if you do, reset LC_NUMERIC
 *   to its sane default: setlocale(LC_NUMERIC, "C").
 * - If a X11 based VO is used, mpv will set the xlib error handler. This error
 *   handler is process-wide, and there's no proper way to share it with other
 *   xlib users within the same process. This might confuse GUI toolkits.
 * - mpv uses some other libraries that are not library-safe, such as Fribidi
 *   (used through libass), ALSA, FFmpeg, and possibly more.
 * - The FPU precision must be set at least to double precision.
 * - On Windows, mpv will call timeBeginPeriod(1).
 * - On memory exhaustion, mpv will kill the process.
 * - In certain cases, mpv may start sub processes (such as with the ytdl
 *   wrapper script).
 * - Using UNIX IPC (off by default) will override the SIGPIPE signal handler,
 *   and set it to SIG_IGN.
 * - mpv will reseed the legacy C random number generator by calling srand() at
 *   some random point once.
 *
 * Encoding of filenames
 * ---------------------
 *
 * mpv uses UTF-8 everywhere.
 *
 * On some platforms (like Linux), filenames actually do not have to be UTF-8;
 * for this reason libmpv supports non-UTF-8 strings. libmpv uses what the
 * kernel uses and does not recode filenames. At least on Linux, passing a
 * string to libmpv is like passing a string to the fopen() function.
 *
 * On Windows, filenames are always UTF-8, libmpv converts between UTF-8 and
 * UTF-16 when using win32 API functions. libmpv never uses or accepts
 * filenames in the local 8 bit encoding. It does not use fopen() either;
 * it uses _wfopen().
 *
 * On OS X, filenames and other strings taken/returned by libmpv can have
 * inconsistent unicode normalization. This can sometimes lead to problems.
 * You have to hope for the best.
 *
 * Also see the remarks for MPV_FORMAT_STRING.
 *
 * Embedding the video window
 * --------------------------
 *
 * Using the render API (in render_cb.h) is recommended. This API requires
 * you to create and maintain an OpenGL context, to which you can render
 * video using a specific API call. This API does not include keyboard or mouse
 * input directly.
 *
 * There is an older way to embed the native mpv window into your own. You have
 * to get the raw window handle, and set it as "wid" option. This works on X11,
 * win32, and OSX only. It's much easier to use than the render API, but
 * also has various problems.
 *
 * Also see client API examples and the mpv manpage. There is an extensive
 * discussion here:
 * https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv-examples/tree/master/libmpv#methods-of-embedding-the-video-window
 *
 * Compatibility
 * -------------
 *
 * mpv development doesn't stand still, and changes to mpv internals as well as
 * to its interface can cause compatibility issues to client API users.
 *
 * The API is versioned (see MPV_CLIENT_API_VERSION), and changes to it are
 * documented in DOCS/client-api-changes.rst. The C API itself will probably
 * remain compatible for a long time, but the functionality exposed by it
 * could change more rapidly. For example, it's possible that options are
 * renamed, or change the set of allowed values.
 *
 * Defensive programming should be used to potentially deal with the fact that
 * options, commands, and properties could disappear, change their value range,
 * or change the underlying datatypes. It might be a good idea to prefer
 * MPV_FORMAT_STRING over other types to decouple your code from potential
 * mpv changes.
 *
 * Also see: DOCS/compatibility.rst
 *
 * Future changes
 * --------------
 *
 * This are the planned changes that will most likely be done on the next major
 * bump of the library:
 *
 *  - remove all symbols and include files that are marked as deprecated
 *  - reassign enum numerical values to remove gaps
 *  - remove the mpv_opengl_init_params.extra_exts field
 *  - change the type of mpv_event_end_file.reason
 *  - disabling all events by default

/**
 * Create a new mpv instance and an associated client API handle to control

 *
 * Some API functions will return MPV_ERROR_UNINITIALIZED in the uninitialized
 * state. You can call mpv_set_property() (or mpv_set_property_string() and
 * other variants, and before mpv 0.21.0 mpv_set_option() etc.) to set initial
 * options. After this, call mpv_initialize() to start the player, and then use
 * e.g. mpv_command() to start playback of a file.
 *
 * The point of separating handle creation and actual initialization is that
 * you can configure things which can't be changed during runtime.
 *
 * Unlike the command line player, this will have initial settings suitable
 * for embedding in applications. The following settings are different:
 * - stdin/stdout/stderr and the terminal will never be accessed. This is
 *   equivalent to setting the --no-terminal option.
 *   (Technically, this also suppresses C signal handling.)
 * - No config files will be loaded. This is roughly equivalent to using
 *   --config=no. Since libmpv 1.15, you can actually re-enable this option,
 *   which will make libmpv load config files during mpv_initialize(). If you
 *   do this, you are strongly encouraged to set the "config-dir" option too.
 *   (Otherwise it will load the mpv command line player's config.)
 *   For example:
 *      mpv_set_option_string(mpv, "config-dir", "/my/path"); // set config root
 *      mpv_set_option_string(mpv, "config", "yes"); // enable config loading
 *      (call mpv_initialize() _after_ this)
 * - Idle mode is enabled, which means the playback core will enter idle mode
 *   if there are no more files to play on the internal playlist, instead of
 *   exiting. This is equivalent to the --idle option.
 * - Disable parts of input handling.
 * - Most of the different settings can be viewed with the command line player
 *   by running "mpv --show-profile=libmpv".
 *
 * All this assumes that API users want a mpv instance that is strictly
 * isolated from the command line player's configuration, user settings, and
 * so on. You can re-enable disabled features by setting the appropriate
 * options.
 *
 * The mpv command line parser is not available through this API, but you can
 * set individual options with mpv_set_property(). Files for playback must be
 * loaded with mpv_command() or others.
 *
 * Note that you should avoid doing concurrent accesses on the uninitialized
 * client handle. (Whether concurrent access is definitely allowed or not has
 * yet to be decided.)

 * Get a notification whenever the given property changes. You will receive

 * for some properties, it may not send updates even if the property changed.
 * This depends on the property, and it's a valid feature request to ask for
 * better update handling of a specific property. (For some properties, like
 * ``clock``, which shows the wall clock, this mechanism doesn't make too
 * much sense anyway.)
 *
 * Property changes are coalesced: the change events are returned only once the
 * event queue becomes empty (e.g. mpv_wait_event() would block or return
 * MPV_EVENT_NONE), and then only one event per changed property is returned.
 *
 * You always get an initial change notification. This is meant to initialize
 * the user's state to the current value of the property.
 *
 * Normally, change events are sent only if the property value changes according
 * to the requested format. mpv_event_property will contain the property value
 * as data member.
 *
 * Warning: if a property is unavailable or retrieving it caused an error,
 *          MPV_FORMAT_NONE will be set in mpv_event_property, even if the
 *          format parameter was set to a different value. In this case, the
 *          mpv_event_property.data field is invalid.
 *
 * If the property is observed with the format parameter set to MPV_FORMAT_NONE,
 * you get low-level notifications whether the property _may_ have changed, and
 * the data member in mpv_event_property will be unset. With this mode, you
 * will have to determine yourself whether the property really changed. On the
 * other hand, this mechanism can be faster and uses less resources.
 *
 * Observing a property that doesn't exist is allowed. (Although it may still
 * cause some sporadic change events.)
 *
 * Keep in mind that you will get change notifications even if you change a
 * property yourself. Try to avoid endless feedback loops, which could happen
 * if you react to the change notifications triggered by your own change.

/**
 * Return a UNIX file descriptor referring to the read end of a pipe. This
 * pipe can be used to wake up a poll() based processing loop. The purpose of
 * this function is very similar to mpv_set_wakeup_callback(), and provides
 * a primitive mechanism to handle coordinating a foreign event loop and the
 * libmpv event loop. The pipe is non-blocking. It's closed when the mpv_handle
 * is destroyed. This function always returns the same value (on success).
 *
 * This is in fact implemented using the same underlying code as for
 * mpv_set_wakeup_callback() (though they don't conflict), and it is as if each
 * callback invocation writes a single 0 byte to the pipe. When the pipe
 * becomes readable, the code calling poll() (or select()) on the pipe should
 * read all contents of the pipe and then call mpv_wait_event(c, 0) until
 * no new events are returned. The pipe contents do not matter and can just
 * be discarded. There is not necessarily one byte per readable event in the
 * pipe. For example, the pipes are non-blocking, and mpv won't block if the
 * pipe is full. Pipes are normally limited to 4096 bytes, so if there are
 * more than 4096 events, the number of readable bytes can not equal the number
 * of events queued. Also, it's possible that mpv does not write to the pipe
 * once it's guaranteed that the client was already signaled. See the example
 * below how to do it correctly.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 *  int pipefd = mpv_get_wakeup_pipe(mpv);
 *  if (pipefd < 0)
 *      error();
 *  while (1) {
 *      struct pollfd pfds[1] = {
 *          { .fd = pipefd, .events = POLLIN },
 *      };
 *      // Wait until there are possibly new mpv events.
 *      poll(pfds, 1, -1);
 *      if (pfds[0].revents & POLLIN) {
 *          // Empty the pipe. Doing this before calling mpv_wait_event()
 *          // ensures that no wakeups are missed. It's not so important to
 *          // make sure the pipe is really empty (it will just cause some
 *          // additional wakeups in unlikely corner cases).
 *          char unused[256];
 *          read(pipefd, unused, sizeof(unused));
 *          while (1) {
 *              mpv_event *ev = mpv_wait_event(mpv, 0);
 *              // If MPV_EVENT_NONE is received, the event queue is empty.
 *              if (ev->event_id == MPV_EVENT_NONE)
 *                  break;
 *              // Process the event.
 *              ...
 *          }
 *      }
 *  }
 *
 * @deprecated this function will be removed in the future. If you need this
 *             functionality, use mpv_set_wakeup_callback(), create a pipe
 *             manually, and call write() on your pipe in the callback.
 *
 * @return A UNIX FD of the read end of the wakeup pipe, or -1 on error.
 *         On MS Windows/MinGW, this will always return -1.
