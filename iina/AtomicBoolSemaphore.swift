/// An atomic boolean combined with a semaphore to allow waiting for the boolean to be set to `true`.
///
/// This class is expected to be used as follows:
/// - This boolean is set to `false`, recreating the semaphore
/// - A single thread waits for this boolean to be set to `true`
/// - Another thread sets this boolean to `true`
/// - The waiting thread is allowed to proceed
///
/// As a semaphore is used the thread can start waiting after the thread has been set to `true` and it will
/// immediately be allowed to proceed. However if this boolean is set to `false` while a tread is waiting,
/// that thread will never be allowed to proceed.
