 Every player contains an InputSectionStack, to keep track of key binding assignments. See `PlayerInputConfig` for more info.

 The data structures in this class should look roughly similar to mpv's `struct input_ctx`, because they result from an attempt to mimic
 its functionality in order to suport all varieties of Lua scripts, while also supporting IINA's needs such as key equivalents set via
 plugins.

   From the mpv manual:
   Input sections group a set of bindings, and enable or disable them at once.
   In input.conf, each key binding is assigned to an input section, rather than actually having explicit text sections.
   ...

   define-section <name> <contents> [<flags>]
   Possible flags:
   * `default`: (also used if parameter omitted)
   Use a key binding defined by this section only if the user hasn't already bound this key to a command.
   * `force`: Always bind a key. (The input section that was made active most recently wins if there are ambiguities.)

   This command can be used to dispatch arbitrary keys to a script or a client API user. If the input section defines script-binding commands,
   it is also possible to get separate events on key up/down, and relatively detailed information about the key state. The special key name
   `unmapped` can be used to match any unmapped key.

   Contents will always contain a list of:
   script-binding <name>
   * Invoke a script-provided key binding. This can be used to remap key bindings provided by external Lua scripts.
   * The argument is the name of the binding.

   It can optionally be prefixed with the name of the script, using / as separator, e.g. script-binding scriptname/bindingname.
   Note that script names only consist of alphanumeric characters and _.

   Example script-binding log line from webm script:
   `ESC script-binding webm/ESC`
   Here, `ESC` is the key, `webm/ESC` is the name, which consists of the script name as prefix, then slash, then the binding name.

   See: `mp_input_define_section` in mpv source

   From the mpv manual (and also mpv code comments):

   The enabled input sections form a stack. Bindings in sections on the top of the stack are preferred to lower sections.
   This command puts the section on top of the stack. If the section was already on the stack, it is implicitly removed beforehand.
   (A section cannot be on the stack more than once.)

   The flags parameter can be a combination (separated by +) of the following flags:
   * `exclusive` (MP_INPUT_EXCLUSIVE):
   All sections enabled before the newly enabled section are disabled. They will be re-enabled as soon as all exclusive sections
   above them are removed. In other words, the new section shadows all previous sections.
   * `allow-hide-cursor` (MP_INPUT_ALLOW_HIDE_CURSOR): Don't force mouse pointer visible, even if inside the mouse area.
   * `allow-vo-dragging` (MP_INPUT_ALLOW_VO_DRAGGING): Let mp_input_test_dragging() return true, even if inside the mouse area.
