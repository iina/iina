 A single KeyInputController instance should be associated with a single PlayerCore, and while the player window has focus, its
 PlayerWindowController is expected to direct key presses to this class's `resolveKeyEvent` method.
 to match the user's key stroke(s) into recognized commands.

 A [key mapping](x-source-tag://KeyMapping) is an association from user input to an IINA or MPV command.
 This can include mouse events (though not handled by this class), single keystroke (which may include modifiers), or a sequence of keystrokes.
 See [the MPV manual](https://mpv.io/manual/master/#key-names) for information on MPV's valid "key names".

 // MARK: - Note on key sequences

 From the MPV manual:

 > It's also possible to bind a command to a sequence of keys:
 >
 > a-b-c show-text "command run after a, b, c have been pressed"
 > (This is not shown in the general command syntax.)
 >
 > If a or a-b or b are already bound, this will run the first command that matches, and the multi-key command will never be called.
 > Intermediate keys can be remapped to ignore in order to avoid this issue.
 > The maximum number of (non-modifier) keys for combinations is currently 4.

 Although IINA's active key bindings (as set in IINA's Preferences window) take effect immediately and apply to all player windows, each player
 window maintains independent state, and in keeping with this, each player's KeyInputController maintains a separate buffer of pressed keystrokes
 (going back as many as 4 keystrokes).
