/// An object that coordinates the operation of multiple threads of execution.
///
/// This class hides the need for different implementations depending upon the macOS version.
/// An [os_unfair_lock](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/os/os_unfair_lock) is preferred for its efficiency,
/// however it was introduced in macOS 10.12, so an
/// [NSLock](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nslock) is used when running under earlier
/// macOS versions.
///
/// The interface exposed is patterned after
/// [OSAllocatedUnfairLock](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/os/osallocatedunfairlock)
/// which is expected to be included in macOS 13.
///
///- Warning: This isn’t a recursive lock. Attempting to lock an object more than once from the same thread without unlocking in
///    between will either trigger a runtime exception (macOS 10.12+) or will block your thread permanently (macOS 10.11).
