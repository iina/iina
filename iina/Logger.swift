/// The IINA Logger.
///
/// Logging to a file is controlled by a preference in `Advanced` preferences and by default is disabled.
///
/// The logger takes a two phase approach to handling errors. During initialization of the logger any failure while creating the log directory,
/// creating the log file and opening the file for writing, is treated as a fatal error. The user will be shown an alert and when the user
/// dismisses the alert the application will terminate. Once the logger is successfully initialized errors involving the file are only printed to
/// the console to avoid disrupting playback.
/// - Important: The `createDirIfNotExist` method in `Utilities` **must not** be used by the logger. If an error occurs
///     that method will attempt to report it using the logger. If the logger is still being initialized this will result in a crash. For that reason
///     the logger uses its own similar method.
