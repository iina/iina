///
/// This slider adds two thumbs (referred to as knobs in code) to the progress bar slider to show the A and B loop points of the
/// [mpv](https://mpv.io/manual/stable/) A-B loop feature and allow the loop points to be adjusted. When the feature is
/// disabled the additional thumbs are hidden.
/// - Requires: The custom slider cell provided by `PlaySliderCell` **must** be used with this class.
/// - Note: Unlike `NSSlider` the `draw` method of this class will do nothing if the view is hidden.
