/// disabled the additional thumbs are hidden.

  // MARK:- Drawing

  /// Draw the slider.
  ///
  /// The [NSSlider](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsslider) method is being overridden
  /// for two reasons.
  ///
  /// With the onscreen controller hidden and a movie playing spindumps showed time being spent drawing the slider even though it
  /// was not visible. Apparently `NSSlider.draw` is not calling
  /// [hiddenOrHasHiddenAncestor](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsview/1483473-hiddenorhashiddenancestor)
  /// to see if drawing can be avoided.  This was noticed under macOS Monterey.  Unknown if Apple addressed this in later macOS
  /// releases.
  ///
  /// The loop knobs are added as subviews to the slider. That should have resulted in the `PlaySliderLoopKnob.draw` method
  /// being called when the slider was being drawn. Prior to macOS Sonoma that did not occur. The assumption is that the
  /// [NSSlider](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsslider) `draw` method was not calling
  /// `super.draw` and that has now been corrected. As a workaround on earlier versions of macOS the loop knob `draw` method
  /// is called directly.
