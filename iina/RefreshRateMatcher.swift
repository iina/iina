import Cocoa

/// An object that provides the implementation for the `Match Refresh Rate` feature.
///
/// When enabled the `Match Refresh Rate` feature will attempt to synchronize the display refresh rate with the frame rate of the
/// video being played when in full screen mode.
///
/// A good reference for this feature is the mpv wiki post [Display synchronization](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/wiki/Display-synchronization).
/// That post covers a broader set of issues. The issue this feature addresses is discussed in the section
/// [xrandr.lua](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/wiki/Display-synchronization#xrandrlua), changing the rate
/// at which the display updates. That section discusses the [mpv-plugin-xrandr](https://gitlab.com/lvml/mpv-plugin-xrandr)
/// Lua script. That script performs the same function as this feature, but only supports Linux.
///
/// The frame rate of the video is based on the mpv [container-fps](https://mpv.io/manual/stable/#command-interface-container-fps)
/// property for which the mpv manual says:
///
/// **container-fps**
///
/// _Container FPS. This can easily contain bogus values. For videos that use modern container formats or video codecs, this will
/// often be incorrect._
///
/// Rather concerning, however this is the same property that is used by the [mpv-plugin-xrandr](https://gitlab.com/lvml/mpv-plugin-xrandr)
/// script.
///
/// This feature must be prepared to adjust the display mode when:
/// - Entering full screen mode
/// - Exiting full screen node
/// - Playing next video in the playlist
/// - The feature is enabled/disabled using the video menu
/// - The space the window is on becomes active/inactive
/// - The display the window is on is connected/disconnected
/// - The display joins or leaves a mirrored set
///
/// This class handles the high level aspects of the feature. The class `DisplaySynchronizer` handles finding a display mode
/// appropriate for the frame rate of the video and changing the mode of the display.
///
/// - Note: Over concerns about whether all the cases where a display could change are handled this class currently includes
///         extensive logging.
