/// Manage process information agent

/// - Attention: This portion of macOS has proven to be **unreliable**. Previously the macOS function
///     [IOPMAssertionCreateWithName](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/iokit/1557134-iopmassertioncreatewithname)
///     was used to create a
///     [kIOPMAssertionTypeNoDisplaySleep](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/iokit/kiopmassertiontypenodisplaysleep)
///     assertion with the macOS power management system. That method returns a status code so IINA was able to detect when
///     macOS power management was malfunctioning. This class now uses the
///     [beginActivity](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/processinfo/1415995-beginactivity)
///     method that does not provide a status code so it will not be obvious when macOS is broken. Should a user report problems
///     with sleep prevention review issues [#3842](https://github.com/iina/iina/issues/3842) and
///     [#3478](https://github.com/iina/iina/issues/3478) to see if they explain the failure.
