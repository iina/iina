# mpv keybindings
#
# Location of user-defined bindings: ~/.config/mpv/input.conf
#
# Lines starting with # are comments. Use SHARP to assign the # key.
# Copy this file and uncomment and edit the bindings you want to change.
#
# List of commands and further details: DOCS/man/input.rst
# List of special keys: --input-keylist
# Keybindings testing mode: mpv --input-test --force-window --idle
#
# Use 'ignore' to unbind a key fully (e.g. 'ctrl+a ignore').
#
# Strings need to be quoted and escaped:
#   KEY show-text "This is a single backslash: \\ and a quote: \" !"
#
# You can use modifier-key combinations like Shift+Left or Ctrl+Alt+x with
# the modifiers Shift, Ctrl, Alt and Meta (may not work on the terminal).
#
# The default keybindings are hardcoded into the mpv binary.
# You can disable them completely with: --no-input-default-bindings

# Developer note:
# On compilation, this file is baked into the mpv binary, and all lines are
# uncommented (unless '' is followed by a space) - thus this file defines the
# default key bindings.
