# Xcode supports a "Preprocess Info.plist File" setting. When this is enabled Xcode will preprocess
# the Info.plist file using the C Preprocessor. The setting "Info.plist Preprocessor Prefix File"
# can then be used to implicitly include a file when preprocessing the Info.plist file. That include
# file can contain definitions for identifiers to be replaced by the C preprocessor.

# IINA enables preprocessing and sets the name of the header file to "Info.h". This script is
# executed in a Xcode build phase to generate that file each time a build is run. This is how build
# specific information can be included in the Info.plist file.

# Follow Xcode guidelines on how to use the echo command to log messages from a script.
